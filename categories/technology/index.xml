The compression code is executed before the queue_backend gets the data so that any queue_backend can benefit transparently from compression without having to add any code to handle it.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: I have no idea for that title, sorry</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2012 22:53:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-26/opensmtpd-i-have-no-idea-for-that-title-sorry/</guid><description>Howdie,
Eric and I had planned a loooooong time ago to have a hackathon this week-end. However, some asshole piece of shit ran into my car while it was parked, made it unable to take the road and flee without leaving a note.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: plenty of news</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2012 22:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-08-21/opensmtpd-plenty-of-news/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a month since my last post but I have an excuse: I was super busy, then I was super on vacation &amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m back again ;-)</description></item><item><title>g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon - part II</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2012 21:43:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-15/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon-part-ii/</guid><description>Yesterday, I came back from Budapest and was too tired to write anything, but here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary of all the features that have been implemented with regard to OpenSMTPD by Eric, Charles and I.</description></item><item><title>g2k12: OpenBSD hackathon</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2012 23:52:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-07-09/g2k12-openbsd-hackathon/</guid><description>Yesterday, after nearly missing my plane by 5 minutes, I finally managed to make it to Budapest for g2k12, the OpenBSD general hackathon.
While this is not my first hackathon, this is the first general one with many hackers working on all kinds of subsystems ranging from ports to network and kernel.</description></item><item><title>OpenSMTPD: development, bug tracker &amp; GitHub</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2012 19:57:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-06-19/opensmtpd-development-bug-tracker-github/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post about OpenSMTPD.

This has the side effect that OpenSMTPD can start using it and while we agreed that we did not want it as a strong dependency, the various backends API allow us to make it a soft dependency that can be removed without breaking the daemon if someone really does not want SQLite linked.</description></item><item><title>Some OpenSMTPD news</title><link>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2012 23:03:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://poolp.org/posts/2012-05-09/some-opensmtpd-news/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a whiiiiiiile since my last OpenSMTPD related post.
