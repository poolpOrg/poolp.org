    TL;DR:
    - NO TL;DR: this time, I spent hours writing, you should spend minutes reading.
    - OK... I explain in WAY TOO MUCH details how to setup a mail server


Wow, that was unexpected
--
In [a previous article](https://poolp.org/posts/2019-08-30/you-should-not-run-your-mail-server-because-mail-is-hard/),
I explained why I think the "mail is hard" myth is unfounded and why I think people shouldn't be discouraged from running their own mail services.
I didn't know this article would gather so much attention,
reaching **over 75k reads in three days** (currently past 85k) when my next most read article reached 15k reads...
in over a year.

I wish I had a soundcloud.
[I have a patreon though](https://patreon.com/gilles).
I also wish I had entered more into details and not covered things so superficially.

And because scalded cat fears even cold water,
I won't do the same error twice and clarify a few things so people don't dive into this article with wrong assumptions.
If you don't want to read my thoughts,
you can [SKIP THEM]({{<ref "#begintech" >}}) and go straight to the setup.


**This article is DENSE** but this is because I will hold hands at an absurd level,
removing all my blabber will only leave very few technical parts.


Self-hosting and encouraging smaller providers is for the greater good
---
First of all,
I was not clear enough about the **political consequences** of centralizing mail services at Big Mailer Corps.

It doesn't make sense for Random Joe,
sharing kitten pictures with his family and friends,
to build a personal mail infrastructure when multiple Big Mailer Corps offer "for free" an amazing quality of service.
They provide him with an e-mail address that is immediately available and which will generally work reliably.
It really doesn't make sense for Random Joe not to go there,
and particularly if **even techies** go there without hesitation,
proving it is a sound choice.

There is nothing wrong with Random Joes using a service that works.

What is **terribly wrong** though is the centralization of a **communication** protocol in the hands of a few commercial companies,
**EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM** coming from the same country (currently led by a lunatic who abuses power and [probably suffers from NPD](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-psychology-of-donald-trump-how-he-speaks/)),
**EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM** having been in the news and/or in a court for random/assorted "unpleasant" behaviors
(privacy abuses, eavesdropping, monopoly abuse, sexual or professional harassment, you just name it...),
and **EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM** growing user bases that far exceeds the total population of multiple countries combined.

Let's put a bit of perspective.
The biggest one of them reports a user base that exceeds **1.4 BILLION** users (April 2018),
roughly the entire population of either one of China or India,
exceeding by four the population of United States by itself,
or by over twenty the population of my own country.
If you counted its users at the rate of one each second,
**it would take you over 44 years to go through**.

Then,
**very far below**,
it is followed by the next one which reported 400 million active users (2018 too),
also exceeds the population of the United States,
being four times the population of Egypt,
and five times the population of my own country.

In many of the mailings I have monitored,
the very first one covered approximately half the recipients e-mail address space...
before the other half was even split in large parts between the _other_ Big Mailer Corps.

This is **NOT** sane, not here, not anywhere, not in any alternate dimension _(insert "sliiiiiiders" whisper here)_.

</center>

Take a moment to let this sink in:

If these companies were somehow required to cut communications with a country for sanctions,
well over a **BILLION** people could be out of reach for the targeted country.
If you think that this is far-fetched,
the users from Iran, Syria, Cuba or Crimea could surely provide you with an alternate point of view after
[discovering they were kicked out of Github](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/) to enforce sanctions on their countries.
But **as annoying as it is**,
git is still a techie thing which mostly impacts techie people,
a minority of human beings...
and it is also decentralized.
Even if Github services are stopped,
the users can move to another platform or self-host easily,
there's no need for interoperability with the punishing country if it wants to cut ties.

E-mails are much different:
they affect everyone,
from all age and all backgrounds,
the consequences of a similar block if it was done by Big Mailer Corps are orders of magnitude harsher.
The people of [shithole countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html) are not only techies that can work around,
they are people who **NEED** interoperability to communicate with the billion and more of people hosted at Big Mailer Corps.
Mail is good for connecting people worldwide in a reliable way,
but this only works if you keep it decentralized,
**NOT** when you centralize it in the hands of a few companies all geolocalized in the same country.

Now that might never happen,
and I would bet heavy money it won't because
[a country known for intercepting communications and spying on the whole world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program))
has far more interest in keeping communications flowing,
but the sole fact that it is **_TECHNICALLY_** possible should be enough to make us all uneasy.
I'm even voluntarily looking away from the reason why I think they won't do it as if it didn't matter.
If Big Mailer Corps were hosted in China we'd be dead worried and already considering a plan out,
but the only reason we're not is because we _think_ we're currently on the "right side" of the fence.

But that's until we're screwed.

So **YES**, I'd rather see a lot more people self-host or **rely on smaller geolocalized providers**,
spreading the SMTP network as much as possible across multiple operators in multiple countries.
I don't think everyone should self-host,
I just think **MORE** people should self-host or move away from Big Mailer Corps into **ANY** other provider...
so there is at least a bit of constraint for them to interoperate with operators outside their gang,
as well as a financial risk for them **IF** they suddenly went rogue.

I'll say it again:

I don't think that either one of the Big Mailer Corps are are evil or bad,
**I use some of their services on a daily basis**,
and most of the people operating them are genuinely seeking the greater good...
however they have grown too big and there needs to be a balance in power because who knows how they'll evolve in the next ten years,
who knows how the politics of their home country will evolve in the next ten years,
and recent news doesn't paint them as heading in the right direction.

I'll conclude by recommanding that you see this **excellent** presentation by Bert Hubert ([@PowerDNS_Bert](https://twitter.com/PowerDNS_Bert)) from PowerDNS,
about how a similar problem is starting to happen with DNS and the privacy and tracking concerns that arise from this.
Many, many, many key points are also valid for mail services.

Proof of work and reputation
---
Then,
I should have expanded a bit on the concept of "proof of work" and reputation.

A lot of people have ignored these in their comments,
focusing on the tech difficulties they faced with their attempts at self-hosting,
whereas others have taken "proof of work" very literally and assumed I was talking about the
[HashCash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash) proof-of-work system.
Nope,
I was really talking about doing some **VISIBLE** work to setup a mail server correctly,
so that Big Mailer Corps actually **SEE** that you are trying to setup a correct mail exchanger,
and **NOT** a "run & discard" spamming instance.
It is not a commonly accepted model,
just my own intuitive model for thinking about how mail exchangers are perceived on the receiving end,
based on my own (good and evil) experience.

The reputation is a concept that is central to e-mail though not many people know about it,
and this explains in large parts why people fail delivering mail here and there.
Reputation is something that you build by **doing things right over a period of time**,
so assuming that you can pop up a new mail server for a domain you created yesterday,
without a website,
without people knowing it,
and start sending mails to everyone's inbox with absolutely no problem whatsoever is deluded.
It doesn't take long and doesn't take much effort to build a reputation,
but there are no shortcuts.
Hackish techniques to work around are the fastest way to earning a long-term poor reputation.

Your reputation and the volumes you send are very tied,
which is why I say small senders shouldn't usually face reputation issues.
Problems start appearing when you become a bulk sender or you manage lists,
but then **if it's your business you're expected to pour work** into how you mail people.

As a small sender,
if you face a lot of issues delivering to Big Mailer Corps,
then you should really question why some marketing companies manage to get through with millions of daily mails that are **veeeeery far** from being clean (for the most part),
while you don't manage to get through with your handful of mails.
Chances are that it's not because mail is hard but because something you do just isn't right.
Your mails are diluted in such a high volume that you're technically **way** below the radar.
You're **not** supposed to face issues unless your domain has poor or no reputation whatsoever.

I'm not saying you will immediately inbox everywhere,
it may take a bit of time to build a reputation,
but as you'll see in this article that I have popped up a new VPS at a new provider,
configured a brand new mail server on a brand new IP that I didn't even carefully chose,
to deliver mail for a domain that is virtually unknown as I bought it a few years ago but never used it.

It inboxed right away at Gmail.
It also inboxed right away at Yahoo.
It also inboxed right away at a mailbox I have hosted on a paying Outlook customer.
And as long as I do things correctly and build a reputation,
there's no reason that will change,
it hasn't been the case on the hundred or so domains I have setup in the last few years.

Outlook's free service is a different beast and deserves an article on its own.
It is virtually impossible to inbox there naturally if you don't have a very good domain or IP address reputation.
You **CAN** inbox there too but it requires a lot of patience,
and cooperation from outlook users who will add you to their contacts and/or open your mail over enough time that your domain is no longer considered new and suspicious.
This means that they junk **pretty much everyone not coming from a Big Mailer Corp** unless they do an absurd amount of efforts.
Makes you wonder why they don't apply the same rules to their paying customers who you will never have issues reaching their Inbox, right ?

Bottom line is that it may take a bit of time to get in everywhere,
but once it's done you should never experience any big issue unless you mess up big time.

**I will write about these concepts** in a future article,
not just throwing ideas in the air,
but showing how the protocol-level behavior of Big Mailer Corps tends to highlight them.
I just need to sort out what I'm comfortable disclosing first,
how much bullshit I want to call on the industry of selling "hot" IP addresses to inbox,
and what I want to say about the scam of paying good money to get certified for easier inboxing.

This is for techies and sysadmins
---
I was not clear enough with **my definition of "hard"** and the target audience.

The fact that I'm surrounded by sysadmins and developers,
both at work and in the OpenBSD/OpenSMTPD communities,
has biased my idea of who reads my articles and what I can assume to be common knowledge and skills.
When I meant that mail is not hard and that more people should self-host,
I meant it for people who are **already used to self-hosting other services**.
People who know how to setup DNS,
how to poke a hole in a firewall,
what reverse DNS is and how TLS works.
People that actually like tweaking a few keys in a configuration file to run a service.

I started receiving comments from people telling me I was wrong about mail not being hard,
because you had to know how to setup your own server,
you had to know about reverse DNS,
you had to know about DNS,
you had to know about TLS,
you had to know about public and private IP addresses,
you had to back things up.
I also received comments from people telling me that I was wrong because mail requires efforts,
that you need to take time setting it up correctly,
that you had to take time to maintain it,
etc...

**They are right**:

Self-hosting mail requires a minimum of knowledge and dedication,
it is not a two-clicks thing,
you need to have some basic knowledge and you have to be willing to pour some time into it.
If you've never touched a DNS zone or if you think that taking an hour to setup something is hard,
then **yes this is hard** and I don't recommend you do it unless you're willing to HAVE to learn a ton of stuff.
You were **NOT** the audience for my previous post,
or this one for the matter,
I'm sorry this was not more clear.

If you're a sysadmin who is familiar with sysadmin work,
then most of the sysadmin work you already do is considerably harder than setting up a mail instrastructure.
I'll reiterate it for you: **mail is not hard**.

NOW, let's get to the real topic of this article (_if you're a sysadmin type of person, that is_).


EHLO hypno.cat
--
For this article, 
we will setup a mail server for [hypno.cat](https://hypno.cat),
a small website for my thriving (hypothetical) hypnotherapist activity.
I registered the website years ago because I liked the name,
but never done anything with it beyond hosting an **awesome** animated file.

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-newdomain.png">
</center>

Google, Bing and Yahoo have somehow known about it for years and indexed that front page,
so they won't consider it as a domain that was just bought by a spammer to start sending mail,
however it is virtually unknown to anyone on the internet because it has no content,
doesn't link to anywhere,
isn't linked from anywhere,
and has never sent or received mails from or to anyone.
It is an important detail because it shows how the age of a domain has a huge impact on your reputation.

I'm going to set it up for real as I write the article,
from the moment I have booted a brand new VPS to the moment I have received mail back and forth to my Gmail account.
I have chosen that one because it is over-represented in the population and this explains why people complained the most about delivery issues there.
I personally think that Outlook is worse in terms of interoperability,
but lets keep that for a future article maybe.

The mail services for [hypno.cat](https://hypno.cat) are going to provide TLS-secured incoming and outgoing e-mail.
They are also going to allow me to submit messages from my smartphone's IMAP client,
the Gmail application,
so my users don't feel much of a change in habits.
I could just as easily provide a webmail,
with [Rainloop](https://www.rainloop.net/) or [Roundcube](https://www.roundcube.net/),
or setup [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) or [mutt](http://mutt.org).
Any IMAP client will work just fine so I will not cover this part,
there are many alternatives and plenty of tutorials on how to set them up already.
There's even techniques to help mail clients auto-discover their configuration,
you can figure that out by yourselves.

My outgoing mail will pass the basic checks at Gmail,
namely SPF, DKIM and DMARC,
which are more than enough to get your mail through.
We could do **a lot more**,
but the goal here is to find the proper balance between doing enough work to look good and remaining simple.

Incoming mail will be filtered to reduce the volume of spam,
either by killing obvious bad senders at session time when they are detected,
or by providing classification so Spam is in a dedicated folder to avoid cluttering the Inbox.
I could stop here,
since that would already be a fairly nice setup,
but I'll also throw in a bit of configuration to teach Dovecot how to train spam detection through moving mail from
the Inbox to Spam and the other way around.
That part is slighly more complex because it relies on Sieve which is not the best piece of engineering,
feel free to discard if you don't care,
I did without it for over ten years.
It's a nice-to-have, not a must-have.


Requirements
--
The very first requirement is to figure out where you are going to run your mail server.

With widepsread permanent connections through DSL or FTTH,
a home connection may be tempting but it is not a good idea as the IP address spaces of ISP are often blacklisted or suffer from a bad reputation to start with.
In addition,
many ISP prevent outgoing SMTP trafic to avoid compromised desktops from becoming spamming bots.
I find the best option to be renting a dedicated server or a VPS from a hosting company after making sure that SMTP trafic is allowed there.

I have rented my dedicated servers at [online.net](https://www.online.net/) for the last twelve years and am very happy with them.
You'll even find on this blog [instructions to run OpenBSD](https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-29/install-openbsd-on-dedibox-with-full-disk-encryption/) on their servers as they don't support it natively.
They do not filter SMTP,
which is good because you can run an SMTP service right away,
however the IP addresses may have been previously used by bad senders and you will want to test them.
If the IP that is automatically allocated to you isn't good,
you can still order an additional one and pick it in a different range after [checking that it isn't in a blacklist](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx),
or that it [doesn't have a bad reputation already](https://www.senderscore.org).

Alternatively,
for the purpose of creating my own commercial mail services,
I started building an infrastructure on [vultr.com](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6831037) (that's a referal link).
I haven't been there for long so I might still change my mind, but **so far** I'm very happy with it.
They filter SMTP by default so you have to open a ticket to explain what you intend to do with mail.
When I explained that I didn't intend to become an ESP but rather provide hosting services,
they were helpful and unfiltered the same day.

It does not matter much where you decide to run you mail server,
but what you need to check is that:

- the host doesn't have a history of hosting spammers and allows you to do SMTP
- you have an IP address that is dedicated to your mail
- you have control of the reverse DNS for that IP address
- your IP address isn't already in blacklists

As long as these requirements are met,
you should be fine.

It is a good plan to prepare for incidents and this is done by using a backup mail server to take over when the primary one is down. I won't cover this as it's not complex, just a matter of an additional DNS record and an additional mail server routing trafic to the primary one, you'll figure this out by yourselves.
**HOWEVER**,
a lot of people mentioned that you can get blacklisted and lose mail,
so I think now is the right time to recommand that **you don't host your different mail servers at the same place**.
You don't want the two of them to go down if there's a power or network shortage in your datacenter,
and you also want to ensure that if your IP range gets blacklisted as collateral damage from an evil neighbor,
the IP of your backup mail server is "far enough" to not be blacklisted too.
This way,
should your primary mail server be temporarily blocked from sending,
it can reroute trafic through the backup mail server until the issue is solved.

I have endured collateral damage on my own setup only once during the last ten years.
It was annoying for sure because incidents are never fun,
but I rerouted trafic to my secondary server to unbreak trafic,
filled the form to delist my IP while providing proof that I was a legitimate sender,
rerouted trafic back when issue was resolved.
It was nowhere near the big deal people make out of it.

**No stress for people who plan ahead**.


The technical stack
--
I will spin a new VPS at [vultr.com](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6831037) (that's still a referal link),
install the latest [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)
[snapshot](https://ftp.eu.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64/) because that's how I roll (this will not be covered in this article),
and build my mail system on top of it.
I will assume OpenBSD throughout the rest of my writing but besides system-specific commands to install packages the configuration should be similar from a system to another.
If you're tall enough to run a mail server,
you should be tall enough to adapt pathnames accordingly or ... just use OpenBSD already !

<center>
  <img src="https://opensmtpd.org/images/opensmtpd.png">
</center>

For the SMTP layer,
which is in charge of exchanging messages between hosts disregarding what users will use acess their mail,
I will be using the [OpenSMTPD](https://www.OpenSMTPD.org/) software.
It is the default SMTP daemon for the OpenBSD operating system and has a portable version which is [available on Github](https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD) with instructions on how to build.
I will write instructions **assuming the upcoming 6.6.0 release** which is due in a few weeks now.
It brings a ton of improvements and I don't want the instructions to be obsoleted and need a rewrite in October.
If you want to mimic my setup,
**I recommend that you either wait a few weeks until that release**,
or you can just use the development branch today and build from source.
We're so close to the release that the development code is pretty much considered stable today.

<center>
  <img src="https://www.dovecot.org/typo3conf/ext/dvc_content/Resources/Public/Images/dovecot_logo_vector.svg">
</center>

For the IMAP layer,
which will allow users to retrieve messages they received and access them from their smartphones or webmails,
I will use the latest version of [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org).
I will also use the Dovecot-Pigeonhole package,
which will allow us to train the antispam solution into learning Ham from Spam.
If you intend to only use a console client over ssh,
such as `mutt` for example,
you can skip that part as OpenSMTPD can deliver in a local mailbox that mails clients can access directly.
In this article,
we setup IMAP because we acually want to read mails from a smartphone as that's what the regular people do.

<center>
  <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ea57696ebeee9a4a6668347acf7ebd8ef8f74ee7/68747470733a2f2f727370616d642e636f6d2f696d672f727370616d645f6c6f676f5f626c61636b2e706e67">
</center>

Finally,
for the spam filtering layer,
I will use the excellent [Rspamd](https://www.rspamd.com) daemon which is far more than *just* an antispam solution.
It provides state of the art spam filtering methods,
but also provides antivirus integration,
dkim signing,
and a ton of modules which you can chose to use or not to fine tune your setup.
In this article,
we'll simply use it for its DKIM-signing and spam filtering features which is the bare minimum we need.


Making myself reachable
--
SMTP is very tighly coupled with DNS and other hosts rely on DNS lookups to find out which machine handle mail for your domain.
This is done through the lookup of MX (Mail eXchanger) records,
so the most minimal thing to do for SMTP to work is to declare an MX record for your domain.
For `hypno.cat`,
the zone contains the following:
```
;; an A (and AAAAA record for IPv6) record is declared to name your mail server

mail.hypno.cat  A       217.69.8.253
mail.hypno.cat  AAAA    2001:19f0:6801:867:5400:01ff:fee7:7af7


;; an MX record is declared to let the world know that mail.hypno.cat handles mail for hypno.cat
;; 0 is the highest preference, if we had a backup MX we'd set a higher number on it,
;; let's keep that for later, shall we ?

hypno.cat.      MX 0    mail.hypno.cat.
;;hypno.cat.    MX 10   mail-backup.hypno.cat.
```

I can verify that everything is fine using the `host` and `dig` utilities to check that the mail server name resolves and that the MX lookup returns the mail server name:
```
$ host mail.hypno.cat
mail.hypno.cat has address 217.69.8.253
mail.hypno.cat has IPv6 address 2001:19f0:6801:867:5400:1ff:fee7:7af7

$ dig -t MX hypno.cat +short
0 mail.hypno.cat.
```

At this point and with these DNS records,
other mail servers can already lookup which MX is responsible for `hypno.cat`,
and contact it when they want to send mail to any address for that domain.


Making myelf look all fine and dandy
--
That's not enough because nowadays you **MUST** have a reverse DNS (rDNS) **AND** Forward-Confirmed rDNS (FCrDNS).

There's a reason for that.
A large number of the hosts spamming the world are compromised machines,
with a large share of them being home computers behind residential connections.
Many of these residential connections don't have rDNS,
don't have FCrDNS,
or have an rDNS that matches a dynamically allocated IP pattern (ie: `123.123.123.123.dyn.adsl.example.com`).
Because they are individually compromised machines,
and not regular servers under the spammers control,
rDNS and FCrDNS can't be configured to look nice...
so it became a proof-of-work to configure your rDNS and FCrDNS correctly while ensuring that it doesn't look like a dynamically allocated IP pattern.
In some of the Big Mailer Corps guidelines this is explicitely stated,
for others you just discover that the hard way.
Either way,
it's a BARE MINIMUM,
make sure that your hostname looks like a REAL mail server (ie: `mail.hypno.cat`, not `www.hypno.cat`).

rDNS is usually out of your control because it's managed in a somewhat special "arpa" zone owned by the IP address owner.
ISP usually don't let you configure it but server providers can't realistically expect their customers not to,
so they generally provide a small form somewhere in their control panels to let you provide the rDNS you want for the IP address they allocated you:

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-vultr-rdns.png">
</center>

If I setup my rDNS to be the same as the forward records I configured above, then I automatically pass the FCrDNS test.
This can be easily verified by looking up the rDNS for an IP address:
```
$ host 217.69.8.253   
253.8.69.217.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.hypno.cat.
$ host 2001:19f0:6801:867:5400:1ff:fee7:7af7
7.f.a.7.7.e.e.f.f.f.1.0.0.0.4.5.7.6.8.0.1.0.8.6.0.f.9.1.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa domain name pointer mail.hypno.cat.
```

Then looking up the IP address for that rDNS:
```
$ host mail.hypno.cat
mail.hypno.cat has address 217.69.8.253
mail.hypno.cat has IPv6 address 2001:19f0:6801:867:5400:1ff:fee7:7af7
```

If they match both ways, then everything's fine.


Avertise which machines are allowed to send mail on behalf of my domain
--
SPF is a mechanism which makes it possible for destination mail servers to determine if a machine was allowed to send mail on behalf of a domain.

How it works is very simple,
basically you add a DNS record to the zone for your domain stating which servers will emit mails.
When a destination mail server receives mail with a sender from your domain,
it checks if the IP address of the server submitting the e-mail is part of the whitelist.

SPF is not mandatory but it is one of the things that makes you look good.
While it is only informative by default,
not necessarily resulting in mails being junked if they fail the test,
it does have an impact on computing the likeliness of a message being a spam when added to other factors.
It is commonly accepted that lack of SPF has a very negative impact on the reputation of a domain,
so given how simple it is to provide the record,
there's simply no excuse.

There are multiple ways to setup SPF,
in this example I will simply set it up so ONLY my mail server can send mail on my behalf:
```
hypno.cat.      IN TXT  "v=spf1 mx -all"
```

Should hosts receive a mail with a sender `@hypno.cat` not originating from `mail.hypno.cat`,
they will be able to assume,
or even enforce,
that it should be rejected.


Prove that I actually authorized the message
--
DKIM is an authentication mechanism by which you can cryptographically sign mails emitted by your mail server,
proving that you saw them and took responsibility in letting them transit.
Hosts receiving these mails can verify that you authorized them,
by verifying the signature and detect possible forgery.

Like SPF,
this is informative by default and failing a DKIM signature or even lacking the mechanism doesn't mean a mail can't inbox,
however it accounts in the bad points given to a sender and degrades the reputation.
It is also commonly accepted that lack of DKIM has a very negative impact on the reputation of a domain,
so again, just do it.

It is slightly more complex than SPF because,
although it also relies on DNS,
for DKIM you have to generate a keypair in order to publish the public key in a DNS record.

**We're in 2019**,
I will be generating a 1024 bits RSA key,
**I know**.

--- BEGIN DIGRESSION ---

2048 bits RSA public keys do not fit in a DNS TXT record and must be truncated into two records,
but not everyone is able to cope with these truncated keys so you may lose DKIM benefits by going 2048 if hosts fail to use your (partial) public key and assume you've failed signing.
Given that we're not looking into security more than trying to look good at this point,
we'll just look the other way while excusing the fact that there's a very moderate risk of impersonation when used in conjunction with SPF.
**This is very bad thinking** but DKIM also has other short-comings and given that virtually everyone does 1024 bits RSA,
I suggest we argue about the 1024 vs >= 2048 key size when we're already successful at exchanging mails with Big Mailer Corps,
but I'll just take a moment to stress out,
without pointing fingers at any,
that even some security companies that actually work in the mail industry have issues with 2048 bits RSA.

Companies that actually provide sender reputation scoring.
Oh, the, irony.

--- END DIGRESSION ---

If this genuinely worries you,
you can still experiment truncating key into two records and see if it suits you,
adapting my example is trivial,
just make sure you have a TXT record with a part of the key and another TXT record with the remaining.

I'll create a directory to hold the keys:
```
# mkdir /etc/mail/dkim
```

Then, the following commands will generate the keypair and extract the public key out of the private key:
```
# openssl genrsa -out /etc/mail/dkim/hypno.cat.key 1024                                       
Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus
..............................++++++
...............++++++
e is 65537 (0x10001)

# openssl rsa -in /etc/mail/dkim/hypno.cat.key -pubout -out /etc/mail/dkim/hypno.cat.pub 
writing RSA key

# cat /etc/mail/dkim/hypno.cat.pub                                                                 
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDThHqiM610nwN1nmV8OMc7PaPO
uJWVGRDz5bWj4cRjTTmQYjJQd02xrydRNrRhjEKBm2mMDArNWjoM3jvN04ZifqJx
DmKr7X8jsYi+MPEHz6wZxB8mayDK6glYTCyx//zl1luUdvm26PutA38K8cgnb7iT
kfVP2OqK6sHAdXjnowIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Finally,
I can create the DNS TXT record by extracting the public key out of the armor delimiters and formatting the content so it displays as follows:
```
20190913._domainkey.hypno.cat.	IN TXT "v=DKIM1;k=rsa;p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDThHqiM610nwN1nmV8OMc7PaPOuJWVGRDz5bWj4cRjTTmQYjJQd02xrydRNrRhjEKBm2mMDArNWjoM3jvN04ZifqJxDmKr7X8jsYi+MPEHz6wZxB8mayDK6glYTCyx//zl1luUdvm26PutA38K8cgnb7iTkfVP2OqK6sHAdXjnowIDAQAB;"
```

The name of the record should be constructed using this pattern: `<selector>._domainkey.<domain>.`,
where `<selector>` is a name you chose and which allows multiple keys to coexist.
I like to use the date at which I generated the keypair,
but whatever you chose,
write it down for later as we'll need it when configuring DKIM signing.

Also,
note that the public key doesn't have to be kept in the directory once it's published in DNS.
It can always be retrieved from the private key should it be needed for some reason,
however I like keeping it around for fast reference.
And make sure the private key isn't world-readable if you have local users on your system,
for some reason OpenSSL thinks private keys should be created `rw-r--r--`.


Instructing hosts what to do with SPF and DKIM failures with DMARC
--
SPF and DKIM are both fine,
but if they're informative then it also mean they don't prevent abuses of your domain name.

DMARC allows instructing a destination mail server what to do with senders that fail SPF and DKIM tests.
Most notably it allows instructing them to reject such senders.

There's no clear indicator that providing a reject policity brings any positive points to a domain over not doing anything,
however there are multiple hints that having a DMARC record has a positive impact over having none,
even if that record states that nothing should be done about SPF and DKIM failures.

The format of DMARC records goes beyond this article and you'll find multiple examples in any search engine,
but a very simple record will simply state a policy (p=) of `none` (`reject` if you want to be harsh, `quarantine` if you need more time to decide).
The percentage field (pct=) declares how many of these mails should be subjected to the DMARC policy,
and the Reporting URI of Aggregated field (rua=) is where you should receive DMARC reports should you want to analyze them (before switching from `quarantine` to `reject` for example).

I'll just setup the most dummy record,
one that will make all Big Mailer Corps see that we care about DMARC even though we don't know what to do with it:
```
_dmarc.hypno.cat.   IN TXT    "v=DMARC1;p=none;pct=100;rua=mailto:postmaster@hypno.cat;"
```


Getting yourself a certificate for TLS
--
There are multiple ways you can obtain a TLS certificate,
and assuming that you are already familiar with hosting other services,
I'll just pretend that you already know how to obtain one from your registrar or from [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

**If you know how to deal with your certifiates, you can just skip this section and go to the next one.**

Since I'm really setting up `mail.hypno.cat`,
I won't be able to continue this article without obtaining a certificate,
so as a courtesy to OpenBSD users I'll document how I will generate mine on a brand new OpenBSD install.
`acme-client` is a utility that lets you request and renew certificates from the console.
It relies on an HTTP challenge,
so it needs to be able to write to a directory that is served over HTTP,
but luckily OpenBSD also ships with an `httpd` daemon that we can use for the challenge.
Because we're EXTRA lucky, it also provides an example configuration file that we can use with almost no change.

Simply copy the example configuration from `/etc/example/httpd.conf` to `/etc/httpd.conf`,
replace `example.com` with `mail.hypno.cat` and remove the tls block since we only care about serving the challenge.
The file should now read as follow:
```
server "mail.hypno.cat" {
        listen on * port 80
        location "/.well-known/acme-challenge/*" {
                root "/acme"
                request strip 2
        }
        location * {
                block return 302 "https://$HTTP_HOST$REQUEST_URI"
        }
}
```

The `httpd` daemon can be started with the following command:
```
# rcctl -f start httpd
httpd(ok)
```

The acme-client itself is straighforward to configure,
again simply copy the example configuration from `/etc/example/acme-client.conf` to `/etc/acme-client.conf`,
replace `example.com` with `mail.hypno.cat` and you should end up with a block like this:
```
domain mail.hypno.cat {
        domain key "/etc/ssl/private/mail.hypno.cat.key"
        domain full chain certificate "/etc/ssl/mail.hypno.cat.fullchain.pem"
        sign with letsencrypt
}
```

at this point you can simply run `acme-client` on the domain:
```
# acme-client -v mail.hypno.cat
[...]
acme-client: /etc/ssl/mail.hypno.cat.fullchain.pem: created
```

The certificate and keys are created at the appropriate place,
we'll later adjust paths in OpenSMTPD and Dovecot to point to the proper files.

You can keep the httpd running for future renewals and call `acme-client` from a cron,
you can shut it down and deal with renewals in another way.
You sort out how you want to renew with the help of the `acme-client(1)` man page.


Installing and configuring Rspamd
--
On OpenBSD, Rspamd is packaged and can be installed with a single command.
We also need to install Redis which is used to store Rspamd statistics and greylisting states (among other things),
as well as `filter-rspamd` which is the piece of code that allows OpenSMTPD to work with Rspamd.
Both of them are also packaged so they can be installed with a single command too.

As I'm writing this,
`filter-rspamd` will only be available in the next OpenBSD release due in October,
so if you want to play with it before then,
you can simply [obtain it from github](https://github.com/poolpOrg/filter-rspamd) and read the README instructing how to build.
Both Redis and Rspamd are already available in OpenBSD packages so the instructions below are already valid for them.

First,
I'll install these packages:
```
mail$ doas pkg_add redis rspamd filter-rspamd
[...]
redis-4.0.14: ok
rspamd-1.9.0: ok
filter-rspamd-0.1.1: ok
The following new rcscripts were installed: /etc/rc.d/redis /etc/rc.d/rspamd
See rcctl(8) for details.
```

Rspamd is highly configurable so if you want to do funky things, it's up to you to go [read the extensive documentation](https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/).
For the purpose of this article I'll keep it very basic,
as is the case on my own machines.

I could edit the configuration in `/etc/rspamd/actions.conf` to adjust junking thresholds to my liking, but the defaults suit me fine so this was just to show them to you:
```
actions {
    reject = 15;    # Reject when reaching this score
    add_header = 6; # Add header when reaching this score
    greylist = 4;   # Apply greylisting when reaching this score (will emit `soft reject action`)
    [...]
```

And what I really, really want is for Rspamd to handle my DKIM signing because this is one of the requirements to not look bad to the world.

This is done by adding the `dkim_signing` filter to the `filters` key configuration in `/etc/rspamd/options.conf`:
```
filters = "chartable,dkim,spf,surbl,regexp,fuzzy_check,dkim_signing";
```

Then providing the configuration to match the DKIM key I generated earlier in `/etc/rspamd/local.d/dkim_signing.conf`:
```
# mkdir /etc/rspamd/local.d
# cat << EOF >/etc/rspamd/local.d/dkim_signing.conf
allow_username_mismatch = false;

domain {
    hypno.cat {
        path = "/etc/mail/dkim/hypno.cat.key";
        selector = "20190913";
    }
}
EOF
```
The `allow_username_mismatch` configuration is needed here because Rspamd expects usernames to contain the domain name,
but **in this setup** OpenSMTPD authenticates against simple usernames.

We're done here, Rspamd and Redis can be enabled so OpenBSD starts them at next reboot:
```
# rcctl enable redis
# rcctl enable rspamd
```

And I can start them right away so we don't have to wait until next reboot:
```
# rcctl start redis
redis(ok)
# rcctl start rspamd
redis(ok)
```

Configuring OpenSMTPD
--
OpenSMTPD is installed by default on OpenBSD so there is no installing phase here.
If you run a different operating system,
either someone has packaged it there and you can install using your package manager,
or you can build from source and install by getting code from [Github mirror](https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD) and following build instructions.

As I'm writing this,
the 6.6.0 release is a few weeks away and the instructions will only work for that version because I want them to still be valid in a year from now.
You can either wait for the release to happen or use the development version (aka "portable" branch) which is very close to what will be released.

The default configuration for OpenSMTPD is suitable for local mail server,
not accepting connections from the outside,
but able to let local users exchange messages between themselves and to a remote host.
It looks like this:
```
#       $OpenBSD: smtpd.conf,v 1.11 2018/06/04 21:10:58 jmc Exp $

# This is the smtpd server system-wide configuration file.
# See smtpd.conf(5) for more information.

table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases

# To accept external mail, replace with: listen on all
#
listen on lo0

action "local_mail" mbox alias <aliases>
action "outbound" relay

# Uncomment the following to accept external mail for domain "example.org"
#
# match from any for domain "example.org" action "local_mail"
match for local action "local_mail"
match for any action "outbound"
```
It uses sane defaults as to make it hard to misconfigure,
so if you're worried about the last line (`match for any`)
turning your server into an open-relay,
don't worry too much as it has an implicit (`from local`).
You would have to very explicitely tell your server to `match from any for any` in order to let spammers abuse you.

I initially wanted to update the configuration file progressively to hold your hand,
but this article grew a lot since my first version.
I'll just put the complete 16 configuration lines configuration file and comment it extensively afterwards:
```
pki mail.hypno.cat cert "/etc/ssl/mail.hypno.cat.fullchain.pem"
pki mail.hypno.cat key "/etc/ssl/private/mail.hypno.cat.key"

filter check_dyndns phase connect match rdns regex { '.*\.dyn\..*', '.*\.dsl\..*' } \
    disconnect "550 no residential connections"

filter check_rdns phase connect match !rdns \
    disconnect "550 no rDNS is so 80s"

filter check_fcrdns phase connect match !fcrdns \
    disconnect "550 no FCrDNS is so 80s"

filter senderscore \
    proc-exec "filter-senderscore -blockBelow 10 -junkBelow 70 -slowFactor 5000"

filter rspamd proc-exec "filter-rspamd"

table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases

listen on all tls pki mail.hypno.cat \
    filter { check_dyndns, check_rdns, check_fcrdns, senderscore, rspamd }

listen on all port submission tls-require pki mail.hypno.cat auth filter rspamd

action "local_mail" maildir junk alias <aliases>
action "outbound" relay helo mail.hypno.cat

match from any for domain "hypno.cat" action "local_mail"
match for local action "local_mail"

match from any auth for any action "outbound"
match for any action "outbound"
```
That's all is needed for our complete SMTP setup.


The first two `pki` lines declare that `mail.hypno.cat` will use the certificate and key we generated earlier for TLS.

The filter lines apply a set of filters to incoming connections,
`check_dyndns` will filter if rDNS matches some patterns,
`check_rdns` will filter if rDNS is missing,
`check_fcrdns` will filter if FCrDNS is missing,
these are builtin filters in OpenSMTPD that you can tweak to filter at different phases or using other criterias.

`senderscore` is a custom filter that you can install either through your package manager (`pkg_add filter-senderscore-0.1.0` on OpenBSD),
or obtain from [Github](https://github.com/poolpOrg/filter-senderscore).
It is not mandatory but I find it particularly useful and will explain why in the next section.
In this configuration,
it will reject a sender if its senderscore is below 10, `junk` message (add X-Spam header) if score is below 70,
and for my own personal pleasure,
add a delay to each response that is proportional to how bad the reputation is so bad senders are slowed down.

`rspamd` is also a custom filter that we installed in the previous section.
There's no configuration as it is fully controlled from the Rspamd daemon responses,
all we need to do is declare it.

If you want to be more conservative and not reject mails to avoid false positives,
you can assign a `junk` action rather than `disconnect` action to builtin filters and remove the `-blockBelow` option in the `senderscore` filter:
```
filter check_dyndns phase connect match rdns regex { '.*\.dyn\..*', '.*\.dsl\..*' } junk
filter check_rdns phase connect match !rdns junk
filter check_fcrdns phase connect match !fcrdns junk
filter senderscore proc-exec "filter-senderscore -junkBelow 70 -slowFactor 5000"
```

This way instead of rejecting sessions,
OpenSMTPD will simply junk them so they are in your Spam folder.
By monitoring what ends in your junk folder,
you can gain confidence and tune settings to match what you really want.

These simple filters,
not even counting rspamd,
are enough to cut most of my Spam turning _hundreds_ of daily spam into a handful.
The `rdns regex` one can be tuned as depending on your country,
you may see patterns that are particularly repetitive and that would never appear in mine.
To ease maintenance,
you can store them in a file, one by line and use the following construct:
```
table <dyndns> file:/etc/mail/path-to-my-regex-file
filter check_dyndns phase connect match rdns regex <dyndns> junk
```

Let's continue dissecting the configuration.

The `table aliases` points to a file with... aliases in two columns.
The left column has the user-part of an e-mail address you receive,
the right column has the user to which it should be delivered (ie: `root: gilles`)
It is recommended that you have aliases mapping `root`, `abuse` and `postmaster` to an account that you actually read.
I didn't do that because I'm going to trash the install after this article,
but do it.

Then comes the `listen` lines.
The first one is the public endpoint that other mail servers can contact to send mails to `hypno.cat`,
it is configured to offer `tls` using the certificate and key for `mail.hypno.cat` and filter incoming sessions through all my filters.
The second one is the endpoint for my own users,
on the `submission` port,
it requires `tls` using the same certificates,
requires `auth` using system users (the default, can be configured otherwise),
and filters through the rspamd filter only so we can DKIM-sign our own messages.

The `action` lines define an action for local mail which is to deliver to a maildir,
while classifying junk in a specific folder and resolving aliases,
the other action is to relay mail and let other host know that we're `mail.hypno.cat` when we greet ourselves.
If a server had multiple IP addresses the relay action should also specify the source address to use (with `src`) to make sure the proper IP address is used,
here I only have one IP address and it is used for mail so I don't have to.

Finally,
the `match` lines are the ruleset.
When an envelope enters the SMTP server through one of the `listen` endpoints,
it is compared to each `match` line one after another until a matching `action` in found or the envelope is rejected.
The conditions are fairly explicit so I won't describe these four lines,
you should be able to figure out by yourself what `from any for domain "hypno.cat"` means otherwise you shouldn't be reading this in the first place.


A few words about SenderScore
----
SenderScore is an IP reputation database which associates a score ranging between 0 and 100 to an IP address.
The score is tied to the volume and behavior observed from these IP addresses,
and while we can't really know HOW these scores are computed because the methodology is not public,
a bit of studying allows confirming that they didn't make these numbers out of nowhere:
they do correlate with delivery and error rates at various Big Mailer Corps and it is possible to influence the scoring with changes of behaviors that also correlate to changes in delivery and error rates.

It is also **VERY** obvious that to build their reputation score they have access to SMTP session informations that only a destination mail server can have,
such as the volume of mails observed from an IP address,
or the ratio of failed vs accepted recipients,
and since the scoring correlates with delivery and error rates in my observations,
this implies that they get this information from Big Mailer Corps.
Do what you want with that bit of information.

Based on **_MY_** understanding,
it is a very interesting indicator to limit the amount of spam hitting you.
I don't trust it to be accurate when it comes to good reputations (because I kinda know how to work a bit around)
but I do trust it to be HIGHLY accurate when it comes to bad reputations,
because it takes a certain amount of doing bad things in high volumes to see a scoring degrade.
If you don't do bulk mailing,
you should definitely either be unknown to them or have a scoring around 95 or above,
otherwise you're very likely doing something wrong.

Not everyone is convinced about SenderScore and some delivery experts claim it's bullshit.
I personally ran months-long experiments graphing daily reputation and volumes,
then comparing them to delivery graphs,
and my opinion is quite the opposite:
to me there is a very significant correlation that definitely helps classify senders.
I think the best approach is to use the filter for junking,
not blocking,
and determining by yourself if you're happy with it.

SenderScore considers that hosts should have a reputation above 70,
I would personnally assume hosts below 80 to be good junking candidates,
and hosts below 10 to be obvious rejects.


Installing and configuring Dovecot
--
OpenBSD also has a package for Dovecot which can be installed with a simple command:
```
mail# pkg_add dovecot
dovecot-2.3.7.2v0: ok
The following new rcscripts were installed: /etc/rc.d/dovecot
See rcctl(8) for details.
New and changed readme(s):
        /usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/dovecot
[...]
```

And,
**specifically for OpenBSD**,
following instructions from the readme,
the `/etc/login.conf` file should contain a `dovecot` class to bump the resources allowed as Dovecot is very hungry for file descriptors:
```
dovecot:\
    :openfiles-cur=1024:\
    :openfiles-max=2048:\
    :tc=daemon:
```

The user `_dovecot` should then use that login class:
```
# usermod -L dovecot _dovecot
```

Once that is done,
there's really not much to do on the Dovecot side except have it point to the proper TLS certificate we generated earlier.

I do that by tweaking the `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` configuration keys in the `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf` file so they read as follows:
```
ssl_cert = </etc/ssl/mail.hypno.cat.fullchain.pem
ssl_key = </etc/ssl/private/mail.hypno.cat.key
```

Then Dovecot must be told that mails should be looked up in the user `~/Maildir` directory as this is where OpenSMTPD drops files.
I do that by tweaking the `mail_location` configuration key in the `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf` file so it reads as follows:
```
mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
```

We're all set, we can enable the daemon so it's started at next boot, and start it right away:
```
mail# rcctl enable dovecot
mail# rcctl start dovecot   
dovecot(ok)
```

At this point,
you can already configure any mail client like `mutt`, `thunderbird` or even the `gmail` app on Android,
so that it uses `mail.hypno.cat` both for incoming and outgoing mails.

Teaching Dovecot to train Rspamd
---
You read until here,
good.

So this is a bonus section,
one that's absolutely not mandatory in setting up your mail server,
but one that I'd like to add because it lets users train the spam filtering the same way they're used to already:
moving a mail to spam, marking a mail as spam or reporting a mail as spam,
whichever it is called on their interface.
The good news is that it integrates with IMAP,
so no matter if they use their smartphone app, a client on their desktop or a webmail,
the action of reporting a spam will automatically train the filter.

How you do that is relatively simple in theory,
it consists of plugging a couple scripts,
one to handle moving a mail from Inbox to Spam and one to handle moving mail from Spam to elsewhere.
In pratice,
Big Mailer Corps filters also detect that you delete a mail without opening it and such,
but let's not get too excited and start with something that's already good enough.
How you do that in practice is a bit more complex,
and that is because we will rely on Sieve which is...
how do you put it with diplomacy ...
"overengineered".

**Given that this is not a critical piece of the setup, you are allowed to shut your brain off and follow blindly instructions. Worst than can happen at this point is that it will not train anything.**

To enable imap sieve,
the Pigeonhole package must be installed,
and as has been the case throughout this article all I need is a simple command:
```
mail# pkg_add dovecot-pigeonhole
dovecot-pigeonhole-0.5.7.2v1: ok

[...]
```

And...
here comes the tricky part, you need to configure Dovecot to enable imap_sieve,
and teach it what sieve scripts to use for what actions.

First, I will need to enable `imap_sieve` in Dovecot by adding it to the mail plugins for IMAP.
This is done by tweaking the `mail_plugins` configuration key in `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-imap.conf`:
```
protocol imap {
    [...]

    mail_plugins = $mail_plugins imap_sieve
 
    [...]
}
```

Then to teach Dovecot how to train,
I'll add the following bit to `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-plugin.conf`,
telling it that there are sieve scripts to trigger when mail gets moved in and out of Junk mailbox:
```
plugin {
  sieve_plugins = sieve_imapsieve sieve_extprograms
  sieve_global_extensions = +vnd.dovecot.pipe +vnd.dovecot.environment

  imapsieve_mailbox1_name = Junk
  imapsieve_mailbox1_causes = COPY
  imapsieve_mailbox1_before = file:/usr/local/lib/dovecot/sieve/report-spam.sieve

  imapsieve_mailbox2_name = *
  imapsieve_mailbox2_from = Junk
  imapsieve_mailbox2_causes = COPY
  imapsieve_mailbox2_before = file:/usr/local/lib/dovecot/sieve/report-ham.sieve

  sieve_pipe_bin_dir = /usr/local/lib/dovecot/sieve
}
```

Now that dovecot is ready,
I'll have to prepare the sieve part which relies on two sieve scripts to train spam and ham inside `/usr/local/lib/dovecot/sieve`:
```
# cat report-ham.sieve

require ["vnd.dovecot.pipe", "copy", "imapsieve", "environment", "variables"];

if environment :matches "imap.mailbox" "*" {
  set "mailbox" "${1}";
}

if string "${mailbox}" "Trash" {
  stop;
}

if environment :matches "imap.user" "*" {
  set "username" "${1}";
}

pipe :copy "sa-learn-ham.sh" [ "${username}" ];
```

```
# cat report-spam.sieve

require ["vnd.dovecot.pipe", "copy", "imapsieve", "environment", "variables"];

if environment :matches "imap.user" "*" {
  set "username" "${1}";
}

pipe :copy "sa-learn-spam.sh" [ "${username}" ];
```

Because both sieve scripts rely on shell scripts `sa-learn-ham.sh` and `sa-learn-spam.sh`,
I also need to create these shell scripts in `/usr/local/lib/dovecot/sieve`:
```
# cat sa-learn-ham.sh

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/rspamc -d "${1}" learn_ham
```

```
# cat sa-learn-spam.sh

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/rspamc -d "${1}" learn_spam
```

And finally,
I need to compile the sieve scripts and make the shell scripts executable so that Dovecot can actually use them:
```
# sievec report-ham.sieve
# sievec report-spam.sieve
# chmod 755 sa-learn-ham.sh
# chmod 755 sa-learn-spam.sh
```

That's all,
now moving mails from a folder to another I can see the following lines in the `/var/log/rspamd/rspamd.log` file:
```
2019-09-13 23:59:46 #18598(controller) <1d44bd>; csession; rspamd_controller_learn_fin_task: <127.0.0.1> learned message as ham: CAHPtQbOxQxBCsVd7nUCP4podu74Pa-F6k28z+4BWfNeeqWYiAg@mail.gmail.com
[...]
2019-09-14 00:01:57 #18598(controller) <b76e28>; csession; rspamd_controller_learn_fin_task: <127.0.0.1> learned message as spam: CAHPtQbOxQxBCsVd7nUCP4podu74Pa-F6k28z+4BWfNeeqWYiAg@mail.gmail.com
[...]
```

I'm sure these can be simplified,
I'll be honest and say that I don't really care because it's just a side-feature,
I'm unlikely to touch the sieve scripts for the next decade,
I don't think anyone should touch sieve scripts,
we should just come with something better that doesn't remind me of m4 wankery.


Testing it all
--
And now, we'll just test that we can do a round-trip from `hypno.cat` to `gmail.com`.

First,
I'll craft a mail from my `hypno.cat` account to my `gmail.com` account:

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-craft-mail.png">
</center>

After sending it,
I'll check it arrives at `gmail.com`:

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-gmail-1.png">
</center>

Then, 
I'll check that it was sent over a TLS-secured channel:

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-gmail-2.png">
</center>

I'll check that `gmail.com` is happy with our SPF declaration,
our DKIM signature and that it saw we had a DMARC record.
You do that by selecting "Show original" in the meny associated to each mail:

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-gmail-3.png">
</center>

And finally,
I'll reply to the mail just to be sure that it works both ways:

<center>
  <img src="/images/2019-09-01-received-mail.png">
</center>


Yay, we're done
--
So this article is dense,
I wanted to _explain_ why we do things,
if you remove all my blabber and focus on the purely technical aspects you'll realize that we built a working mail infra,
providing TLS inbound and outbound services,
with DKIM, SPF and DMARC compliant outgoing trafic,
and spam-filtered incoming trafic.
And we did this by:

- adding a couple A records, an MX record and three TXT records to our DNS zone
- making sure rDNS was properly set
- installing TLS certificates
- building a ~15 lines configuration file for an SMTP server
- modifying 3 lines in the default configuration of an IMAP server
- modifying 8 lines in the default configuration of an antispam solution

And because we were in a very good mood and willing to take an extra step to help users train antispam,
we implemented ham and spam training of Rspamd by:

- modifying approximately 20 lines in the default configuration of an IMAP server
- copying 4 sieve scripts in a directory

Agreed,
it may take a new comer some efforts to come up with these without help,
but none of these tasks qualify as hard or tricky.
In addition,
pretty much all of them are only one-time operations,
you don't edit the DNS zone or reset your rDNS every two days,
just like you don't touch your working configuration once in place unless you have a new use-case.
It may happen that you have to do a maintenance,
whatever that means,
but I don't see a scenario where such a maintenance would imply having to do "all" of that again.

That being said,
after you do it a few times,
it takes about ten minutes to replicate this setup from scratch as you'll know what you're doing,
because... you know, mail is not hard.


So what should you do next ?
--
What you should do next is setup redundancy to ensure that a failure of your mail server does not causes mail loss.

In practice,
most mail exchangers will retry if their destination is down,
so **even** if you endure a downtime,
most of your mails will be buffered by your sender and resumed when your server is back.

In theory,
you still want to do things right,
and letting others buffer your own messages to cope with your downtimes is fairly impolite as they bear responsibility of your messages far longer than they should...
You should investigate how to setup a backup mail exchanger,
arrange with friends you trust to backup each other,
or even subscribe to a service that will offer backup mail to you.
Anything as long as you know a secondary server will be able to cover for you if you have a downtime.

Then,
no matter which way you chose to do it,
it will boil down to:

- adding an additional MX record to the DNS zone
- configuring a backup mail server so it forwards mail for your domains to your mail server

Rocket, science.


Are we done ?
--
As I said earlier,
I will write another article to discuss reputation,
as well as some of the mechanisms in place at Big Mailer Corps that can cause people to fail delivery.

If these topics are of interest and I get positive feedback,
I might just write more often about deliverability concepts,
otherwise I'll just resume what I was doing before:
writing about my monthly opensource contributions.
It's up to you :-)

Finally,
in this article I have described a very simple setup but there are tons of interesting stuff you can do with mail infrastructures if you're not scared of working a bit on it.

I'm currently building an infrastructure for a future mail hosting service which spans over multiple data centers in multiple countries,
which has a very high tolerance to failures,
has backup mail servers to cope with very extreme failures of primary mail servers,
can very easily scale to bursts of volumes,
that decorrelates incoming and outgoing trafic so it can provide partial services to people,
that can easily reroute trafic across machines to work around failures,
while providing IMAP services to virtual accounts on a multitude of domains,
all with daily backups of all mail directories.
The infrastructure currently costs me... less than 75 EUR a month.
It is also fairly simple with most machines being default installs of OpenBSD with **very few** changes to the base system.

If reading about how you can build such setups is of any interest,
I could also write about it to help people build MORE hosting alternativess which is ultimately what I hope for.

Thanks for reading me,
I still don't have a soundcloud,
however [I still have a patreon](https://patreon.com/gilles) if you want to support me,
or **use the widgets right below the comment link** to share this article on social medias.

If you find errors in this article,
please let me know so I can fix them,
I started writing this article late and continued half-way through the night so I might have let errors slip in despite multiple readings.
